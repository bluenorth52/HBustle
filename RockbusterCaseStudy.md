# Rockbuster Stealth LLC Case Study
The aim of this project was to help fictious movie rental company Rockbuster Stealth LLC understand their film inventory and customer habits to prepare them for a launch of their own movie rental service. This project is unique in that it only uses PostgreSQL to gain insights to the data and answer business questions.
